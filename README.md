# Welcome to the Data Cleaning Repository! üö¥‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èüìä

This repository highlights my process for cleaning and transforming raw datasets using Python. The data used for this project is a bike sales dataset(sourced from Kaggle). The goal was to take the raw, unprocessed data and convert it into a clean, structured format suitable for analysis and actionable insights. 

I used Python and it's library(**Pandas**) throughout this project. This repository serves as a demonstration of data cleaning skills and offers a starting point for those who want to explore clean datasets or learn about data preparation.


## Dataset Overview
The bike sales dataset includes:
- Customer information (age, gender,country, state)
- Bike purchase details (date, type, cost, profit, revenue)
- Additional columns that were cleaned and processed

The cleaned version focuses on preparing this dataset for analysis by handling missing values, standardizing formats, and correcting inconsistencies.


## Data Cleaning Process
The following steps were performed on the dataset:
- Removed of blank spaces : To prevent inaccuracies and inconsisteny.
- Handled Missing Values : Replaced or removed null entries.
- Standardized Columns: Renamed and reformatted for consistency.
- Removed Duplicates: Ensured uniqueness in critical rows.
- Fixed Anomalies: Corrected incorrect or inconsistent entries.



## Futher
This dataset can now be used for:
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Predictive Modeling
- Visualizing Insights using Dashboards
